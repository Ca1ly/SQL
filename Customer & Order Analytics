FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
Select count(orderID) From BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
Select acctnum From FebSales
 join customers
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
Select Distinct Product, MIN(price) From JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select

product, 
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
